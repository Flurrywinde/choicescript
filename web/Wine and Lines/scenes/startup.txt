You step into Glazer's Bar where tonight a speed dating event is being held, and it's alive with activity, men and women of all ages, some excited, others shy, all here in the hopes of meeting that special someone.

At this point, I'll need to know a little bit about you. First, are you a man or a woman?

Thank you. I feel like I'm getting to know you very well already, but too bad I am just a computer game not interesting in dating anyone at the moment. Until I get a proper emotion chip installed, you will have to resign yourself to the other characters in the story, sad to say. 

Next, just between us, I would like to know your intentions tonight? Think of me as your invisible, virtual confidante on your shoulder. No one, not even the organizers of this speed dating event ever need know your private intentions, but they will of course affect your character and therefore the course of the game. Please select how your character honestly feels:
*choice
	#I'm looking for casual fun, maybe noncommital sex if it feels right
		*set goal "1"
		*goto getstats
	#Casual fun but no sex. It leads to relationships which is something I do NOT want.
		*set goal "2"
		*goto getstats
	#To meet people and maybe get into a relationship, but it's not important.
		*set goal "3"
		*goto getstats
	#I want to get into a relationship but need to take it slow.
		*set goal "4"
		*goto getstats
	#I'm ready for a relationship, and if I find "the one" tonight, that'd be awesome!
		*set goal "5"
		*goto getstats
	#I'm lonely and desperate to get into a relationship as soon as possible.
		*set goal "6"
		*goto getstats		

*label getstats
In this test game, you are good-looking, well off financially, AND are suave and comfortable around the opposite sex. Lucky you!

Welcome, $!{name}, to this month's Speed Date Night at Glazer's Bar! No one welcomes you at the door. It's just you and me, your virtual narrator, who, for all intents and purpose does not even exist other than to have asked you all those questions just now. You can safely ignore me. Really, you can. Go. Go and [i]mingle[/i] or do whatever you primate-descended carbon-based bags of mostly water do when you play the dating game.

	#Get a drink at the bar

*set drank true
Ah, liquid courage, always a good choice for times like these when you might get nervous, and just a single drink shouldn't make you look too much like a lush, would it? You certainly hope not, and maybe it even makes you look sophisticated and charming!

You're sipping your drink when a woman wearing a plastered on smile approaches you.

"Hi," she says, all fake-bubbly. "Are you here for Speed Date?"

"I sure am!" you say, all warm, toasty, and liquid-courage-ified.

"Great!" she says, her fake smile never wavering for an instant. After getting your name and checking her list, she tells you how it all works. 
*goto howWorks

*label organizer
You can't miss her. She's sitting at a little table near the entrance, fingers flying over the papers attached to a clipboard like she's done this a thousand times, all the while wearing a plastered on smile meant to be welcoming but instead just wreaks, "Fake!" Still, you have no choice--you walk up to the table and get in line.
		
When it comes to your turn, you give her your name, and after making sure you're on the list, she tells you how it all works.
*goto howWorks

*label howWorks
Basically, you meet a new ${manWoman} for five minutes, then move on, meeting a total of ten new people. After it's all done, you submit a list of everyone you're interested in seeing again, and that's it--you go home. Tomorrow, you'll get an email with a list of all the people where there's a mutual interest, whereupon you can contact them and set up a date. Sounds like fun, right? I see your primate mating rituals have progressed beyond dowries and bonks on the head, but luckily for my amusement, they're still quite funny, at least until I have a proper Social Chip installed.
*page_break Go to your first five-minute date!

*if lookingFor = "f"
	*set date "Clarissa"
	The first girl you meet is a dirty blonde with a shoulder-length, peekaboo haircut. She's in a red business suit and looks very professional, wearing pearl earrings with a golden star around them. She smiles when she sees you and seems friendly, excited to be here. 
	
	Her name is Clarissa.
	*goto date1_choice
*else 
	*set date "Curtis"
	The first guy you meet is blond with short hair combed into a flat top. He looks almost like an aging surfer, probably once drop dead gorgeous, but now he's in a business suit with wrinkles just beginning to form around his eyes. They make him look tired, as if he's stayed up all night, but it's probably just age and stress. His demeanor is type A, however, strong, forceful, but also friendly, a good talker with a powerful voice which sets you instantly at ease. 
	
	His name is Curtis.

"Actually, I just moved here from Chicago," Clarissa says, smiling, talking a bit fast but seeming at ease with you. "How about you?"
*choice
	#Answer politely and talk about Chicago for awhile.
		You tell Clarissa where you're from and learn many interesting facts about Chicago, such as how the Chicago River once flowed the other way but got reversed through a feat of engineering.

		*gotoref gobackto
	#Answer politely but ask her another question as soon as possible.

		"For work," Clarissa replies. "It's a financial planning firm. The chance for a promotion came up, and I took it, even though it meant moving here where I don't know anybody. What do you do, career-wise?"

"I have no interest in you," you say, flat out.

Clarissa's mouth drops open, but she quickly recovers. "You've got gall; I'll give you that much," she says coldly. "Thanks for your honesty. I feel like I dodged a bullet."

The two of you sit and ignore each other for the rest of the five minutes.
