Propect for assassin recruitment: Brad Ellis, age 17, Lockview High School, Lockview, CA
*page_break

You are Brad Ellis, 5'9", 173 lbs.

You go to an average high school in an average sized town. You live with an alcoholic mother you never see, and you don't know who your father is. You only have one friend, Chris Bean, and all you ever do is sit around in the nearby woods, drinking and shooting your many guns. It's all easy enough to get if you know the right people.

The other kids in school picked on you and Chris when you were younger, but now they don't anymore. Everyone knows you have guns, and sometimes you even sneak them into school. Your school is so lame it doesn't even have metal detectors yet.

One day Chris is angrier and more sullen than he usually is.

You ask Chris if something's wrong.
	
"Wrong question," he snaps. "Instead you should be asking what's right or even what's okay. Answer: Nothin'! But if you must know what's wrong, the answer is, 'Everything.' School sucks. We're seniors now. Do you know what you're going to do after we graduate? That is if we even graduate. We're in remedial everything and still flunking. We're losers, dude, and it's only gonna get worse. I don't want to work some shit job for fifty years and then die, pissing myself in some nursing home. Let's go out with a bang. Let's pull a fuckin' columbine."

"I thought you'd never ask," you say. "I've been thinking about it for a long time, and you're right. To Live is to Die."

You both go home to get ready, clean your guns, get some sleep.

You're so hyped up it takes a long time for you to fall asleep, but you finally do around 3 am. You wake up sometime later with a start. It's still dark out, but something feels wrong. Someone else is in your room.

You know that if you call out or turn to look, the intruder will know you're awake. You wonder if it's your mom, but she never comes in your room, let alone this time of night. No, it must be a burgler, and if it is, you're gonna kick some serious ass. All your guns are loaded, and they're very near the bed. Your glock is on the nightstand next to you.

You lie deathly still, waiting for the slightest sound, the seconds ticking by like hours... It never comes.
