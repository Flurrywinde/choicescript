[style=id=secret flash-bg nodisplay ]The password is '[style=red]${password}[/style]'![/style] Did you [style=${linkcolor} font150 underline-dashed]see[/style] it?
*page_break Enter password
*if not(sawpassword)
  You did not see the password.
  *if secretclick
    Or did you! Hmm... Something's suspicious... Well...
  *else
    But you can guess anyway!
*else
  I hope you remembered the password!

*temp guess
What is the password?
*label guesspassword
*input_text guess

*if guess = password
  Correct!
  *if not(sawpassword)
    How did you know???
    *if secretclick
      I think maybe you cheated somehow!
  *else

    And yeah, all is well and good. You may pass... But! There is still a [i]secret[/i] in the previous page... See if you can find it!
*else
  That is not the password.
  *if secretclick
    I guess my suspicions were incorrect. You get another chance!
  *else
    Try again!

Your majesty, your people are starving in the streets, and threaten revolution.
Our enemies to the west are weak, but they threaten soon to invade.  What will you do?

*choice
  #Make pre-emptive war on the western lands.
    If you can seize their territory, your kingdom will flourish.  But your army's
    morale is low and the kingdom's armory is empty.  How will you win the war?
    *choice
      #Drive the peasants like slaves; if we work hard enough, we'll win.
        Unfortunately, morale doesn't work like that.  Your army soon turns against you
        and the kingdom falls to the western barbarians.
        *finish
      #Appoint charismatic knights and give them land, peasants, and resources.
        Your majesty's people are eminently resourceful.  Your knights win the day,
        but take care: they may soon demand a convention of parliament.
        *finish
      #Steal food and weapons from the enemy in the dead of night.
        A cunning plan.  Soon your army is a match for the westerners; they choose
        not to invade for now, but how long can your majesty postpone the inevitable?
        *finish
  #Beat swords to plowshares and trade food to the westerners for protection.
    The westerners have you at the point of a sword.  They demand unfair terms
    from you.
    *choice
      #Accept the terms for now.
        Eventually, the barbarian westerners conquer you anyway, destroying their
        bread basket, and the entire region starves.
        *finish
      #Threaten to salt our fields if they don't offer better terms.
        They blink.  Your majesty gets a fair price for wheat.
        *finish
  #Abdicate the throne. I have clearly mismanaged this kingdom!
    The kingdom descends into chaos, but you manage to escape with your own hide.
    Perhaps in time you can return to restore order to this fair land.
    *finish
