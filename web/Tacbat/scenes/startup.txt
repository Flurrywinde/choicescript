You are the monarch of Rel-Aktu, a small fiefdom on the eastern coast of the continent of Glendor. The crown is yours by divine right for you are descended from a long line of kings, and you intend to carry on their traditions to the fullest. Battle brings glory, and so, TO WAR!
*page_break Meet with your military advisors

Rel-Aktu is predominantly human. Elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, and trolls live in isolated pockets here and there in areas suited to their race. Relations with all are tense but quiet, basically neutral but with mutual suspicion, distrust, and the occasional raid.

You have three squads of twelve crack human warriors, your royal guard, who fight with sword and shield. Peasants can be conscripted, many with experience as spearmen capable of fighting in a phalanx, though their strength, skill, and bravery often leaves much to be desired.

Tax rate is currently fair, generating a modest income.
