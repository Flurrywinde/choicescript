# Generate an index.md file containing a list of all games. Must be run from a choicescript root folder, i.e. one with a web/ folder in it that contains a sub-folder for each game.

# Optionally, if there's an images/ folder in the game folder, a link to this image is included. Also, optionally, if there's a gamedesc.txt file in the game folder, its contents will also be included.

# By default, the game name is the folder name, but if the first line in gamedesc.txt begins with "Title:", the rest of that line will be used instead.
